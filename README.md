## Project description

PandaGathers allows users to join an existing order nearby. Users can see all orders that are available for joining. They can select one and proceed with the order, but they have limited time to confirm it.

This gives the user a small discount on the delivery and reduces CO2 emissions by saving a trip. Users earn points for every PandaGather they join. Based on their points, they are assigned a tier represented by an animal. Their avatar picture will be the tier animal, personalized to the type of food they like to order and other factors to make it unique.

If a user orders frequently from a certain place, they will receive a notification when a PandaGather is available for that restaurant and their location. They can enable PandaGather for each savedlocation.
